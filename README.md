Django Object Actions
=====================

If you've ever tried making your own admin object tools and you were like me,
you immediately gave up. Why can't they be as easy as making Django Admin
Actions? Well now they can!

This is very similar to [django-object-tools], but does not require messing with
your urls.py, does not do anything special with permissions, and uses a subset
of the language you already know from making [django admin actions].
